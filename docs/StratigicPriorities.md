## 🎯 Strategic Priorities

### What Should We Focus On?
Based on the gap analysis, prioritize:

1. **Kitchen Layout Designer** (Months 3-4)
   - Biggest missing feature
   - High user value
   - Differentiates from simple tools

2. **Cabinet Type Expansion** (Months 1-2)
   - Wall cabinets are essential
   - Quick wins for functionality
   - Enables complete designs

3. **Cut Optimization** (Months 5-6)
   - High value for shops
   - Reduces material waste
   - Practical business benefit

4. **Professional Outputs** (Ongoing)
   - Better cut lists
   - Shop drawings
   - Client presentations
   - Quote generation

### What Can Wait?
- CNC integration (unless target users demand it)
- Mobile apps (PWA is sufficient initially)
- Advanced rendering (nice-to-have, not critical)
- AI features (future consideration)
