# Smart Defaults - Quick Start Guide

## What is Smart Defaults?

Smart Defaults automatically calculates and applies optimal measurements for your cabinet drawers and doors, saving you time and ensuring professional results.

## How to Use

### 🎯 Smart Drawer Fill

**When to use:** You want to quickly fill a cabinet with properly sized and spaced drawers.

**Steps:**
1. Create or select a cabinet
2. Navigate to the **DRAWERS** section in the control panel
3. Click the **✨ Smart Fill** button
4. Done! Your cabinet now has optimally sized drawers with proper spacing

**What it does:**
- Automatically determines the best number of drawers for your cabinet height
- Calculates ideal drawer heights (small, medium, or large)
- Positions all drawers evenly from bottom to top
- Applies standard 1/8" reveal spacing between drawers
- Accounts for toekick height if present

**Example Results:**
- **18" tall cabinet**: 2 drawers @ 8.9" each
- **30" tall cabinet**: 1 small (4") + 2 medium (12.9") drawers
- **36" tall cabinet**: 1 small (4") + 1 medium (6") + 2 large (12.9") drawers
- **84" tall cabinet**: Multiple drawers optimized for tall pantry cabinet

### 🚪 Smart Door Count

**When to use:** You're not sure how many doors your cabinet should have.

**Steps:**
1. Select a cabinet
2. Find the **Number of Doors** input in the control panel
3. Click the **✨ Auto** button next to the door count
4. The optimal door count is automatically set

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your cabinet width
- Suggests door count based on industry standards
- Ensures doors are a comfortable size (not too wide or narrow)

**Guidelines:**
- **12-24" wide**: 1 door recommended
- **24-48" wide**: 2 doors recommended
- **48"+ wide**: 3 or more doors recommended

## Benefits

✅ **Professional Results**: Industry-standard spacing and proportions  
✅ **Consistent**: All cabinets follow the same spacing rules  
✅ **Error-Free**: No more drawer overlap or spacing mistakes

## Manual Override

Don't worry - you can still manually adjust everything after using Smart Defaults:
- Drawer heights can be modified individually
- Drawer positions can be moved
- Door counts can be changed
- Add or remove drawers as needed

Smart Defaults just gives you a great starting point!

## Standard Reveal (Gap) Specifications

The system uses industry-standard spacing:
- **Drawer-to-Drawer**: 1/8" (0.125") gap
- **Door-to-Door**: 1/8" (0.125") gap
- **Door-to-Drawer**: Configurable (default 1/8")

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Set Cabinet Dimensions First**: Make sure your cabinet width, height, and depth are correct before using Smart Defaults
2. **Enable Toekick First**: If you want a toekick, enable it before using Smart Drawer Fill
3. **Try It Multiple Times**: Click Smart Fill again if you change cabinet height
4. **Mix and Match**: Use Smart Fill to start, then manually adjust specific drawers

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While Smart Defaults doesn't have dedicated shortcuts, you can:
- Use **Tab** to navigate to the Smart Fill button
- Press **Enter** or **Space** to activate it
- Use **Cmd+Z** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Z** (Windows) to undo if needed
